* Uses the superseded package: 'doSNOW': this is to provide continuously updated progress bars when performing parallel computations (not available in doParallel so far as doParallel calls the combine function only when all results have been accumulated). When this option is avalaible in doParallel the switch to this package will be made.

* possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION: These words are not mis-spelled.


## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of speaq. 
All packages passed.
