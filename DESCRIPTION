Title: Tools for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectra Alignment, Peak Based Processing, Quantitative Analysis and Visualizations

Description: The speaq package is meant to make Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) data analysis as easy as possible by only requiring a small set of functions to perform an entire analysis. speaq offers the possibility of raw spectra alignment and quantitation but also an analysis based on features whereby the spectra are converted to peaks which are then grouped and turned into features. These features can be processed with any number of statistical tools either included in speaq or available elsewhere on CRAN.
